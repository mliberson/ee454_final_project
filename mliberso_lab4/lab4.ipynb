    "# Program Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The both programs have the same structure and can be divided into three steps: generating the task queue for each time quantum, running the round robin algorithm for each time quantum, and calculating the cost of the scheduled tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "The task queues are generated for all time quantums before the round robin algorithm allocates the tasks to VMs. For each time quantum, the task queue-generating algorithmchecks if the task is ready at that time. If it is, the task is added to the queue for that time. If the task lasts multiple time quantums, then it is added to the queue of the following time quantums until it's spread over enough time quantums that it will be able to complete. However, if a task is not ready at the current time, the time is incrimented and the steps are repeated to fill the next task queue. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then, for each time quantum, the round robin alogorithm runs on the task queue for that time. The round robin algorithm will then allocated as many tasks as possible to the available VMs. For each task, the algorithm checks if the next available VM can fit those tasks. If so, then the task is allocated and the CPU and MEM space it uses is removed from the available space. Otherwise, the algorithm goes through all other VMs to see if it can fit in their spaces. If so, it is allocated to that VM. If the task cannot fit in any VM, it is appended to the reject queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "At each time quantum, the powerConsumption algorithm then calculates the power used by the VMs. The power for each VM is calculated as the sum of the dynamic and static powers for that VM. The power for each VM is then summed to get the total power consumed at that time. This total is then returned to the main program. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main program will multiply the power at each time by a constant dependent on that time to get the cost at that time. The power and cost can then be summed across all times. This produces the total power and cost used by the tasks when allocated using RR. "
